# This is Mars

Mars is a command-line interface tool designed to assist developers and power users with daily tasks right from the terminal. The goal is is for you to have access to basic, medium and advanced functions that are frequently used in most workflows. This project is developed in Rust as a side hustle and a way to automizing my computer and personal workflow.

Mars is currently supported on Windows for anyone who wants to use it and test it out!
